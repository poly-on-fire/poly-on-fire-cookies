# poly-on-fire-cookies
Polymer Firebase component that uses cookies. This was a trial and error app for me, may not be useful for others.

#Motives
This project is for testing the iron-cookie element, one of several listed
on webcomponents.org in January 2018.

iron-cookie was chosen for testing primarily because it was the only one written in Polymer2. :) May not be the best criteria, but I don't know much about cookies, so if this works for my minimal needs, so be it.
