##### A project for learning an aspect of developing a Polymer app, deployed on Firebase hosting.

The idea is to prove out an approach or component in the simplest project first, before combining it with other code in a real project.

# \<poly-on-fire-cookies\>

## What it does:

Polymer Firebase component that uses cookies. This was a trial and error app for me, may not be useful for others.

# Motives
This project is for testing the iron-cookie element, one of several listed
on webcomponents.org in January 2018.

iron-cookie was chosen for testing primarily because it was the only one written in Polymer2. :) May not be the best criteria, but I don't know much about cookies, so if this works for my minimal needs, so be it.
